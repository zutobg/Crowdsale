# Crowdsale and Token Details

## SOLID Token Details
* ERC20 mintable token
* 18 decimal places
* 1 Solid token = 0.015 ETH

* Total max supply: 4,000,000 SOLID tokens


6-month non-transferable period on all tokens, from the deployment of the token.

## Sale Details
### Sale
- Total cap for sale to be 800.000 SOLID tokens.
- Length: 4 weeks

### Bonus Structure
Every week of the sale has a different bonus, with no individual cap, meaning that all tokens could be sold in the first week.
- Week 1 - 25% Bonus
- Week 2 - 15% Bonus
- Week 3 - 5% Bonus
- Week 4 - No bonus

### General Rules
- Targeted at auditors, Ethereum projects, developers and security experts
- No Soft Cap (no Refunds).
- No Token Burning
- Minimum Participation: 0.5 ETH
- Maximum Participation: 100 ETH
- Funds are sent to a multisig ETH
- Auction type: static price
- Only ETH is accepted
- KYC whitelisted addresses only



__Whale protection:__  Combination of maximum participation limit and KYCâ€™d addresses.

__Edge Cases:__ Last transaction for sale should get refunded whatever it sent over.

## Intended Behavior

The sale is based on the Open Zeppelin framework, with a few additions, the biggest one being stages, because there will be multiple phases.

1) Sale is deployed with `SETUP`.
2) After configuration the sale moves to `READY`.
3) When the start date arrives the sale should go to `DISCOUNT`(either by calling `updateStage` or making a purchase), since it's resolved in `timedTransition`
4) The `DISCOUNT` stage ends when either the cap is reached or the endTime arrives.
  * If the cap is reached the stage will move during the last transaction in the `_postValidatePurchase`
  * If the time is reached, the transition must happen in `updateStage`, since making a purchase will revert the stage.
  * If the sale enter the state where the cap haven't been reached but the remaining amount is less than the minimum purchase, the transition should happen in `updateStage`;
5) The `MAINSALE` should start when the time arrives, either by calling `updateStage` or making a purchase.
7) The `MAINSALE` stage ends when either the cap is reached or the endTime arrives.
  * If the cap is reached the stage will move during the last transaction in the `_postValidatePurchase`
  * If the time is reached, the transition must happen in `updateStage`, since making a purchase will revert the stage.
  * If the sale enter the state where the cap haven't been reached but the remaining amount is less than the minimum purchase, the transition should happen in `updateStage`;


The other meaningful addition is the `changeDue` and `capReached` variables.

The change is needed when a purchase is overpaid, either when a buyer sends more than the personal cap or more than what is available. This should be calculated in `_preValidatePurchase` and saved in the storage to be transferred back to the buyer in the `_postValidatePurchase`.

All the sale parameters should be increased considering only the accepted amount.

Lastly, there's the added mechanism for minting and distributing the non-sale tokens.
The values will be harcoded in the `Distributable.sol` with percentages. When the sale is finalized the tokens will be distributed following the rules:

* The amount sold in both sale stages will be 60% of the total Tokens
* The other addresses percentages must account up to 40%
* If a given address has rights to 5%, it means that it will receive 5% of the total tokens (even if not all of them are minted yet);


##### Note on units
Given the solidity restriction to floating point numbers, some variables are considered differently.
* The `rate` will be divided by `1000`. A rate of `15` actually means `0.015`. This is considered in the contracts
* The `percentages` will be divided by `10`. A percentage of `14` means `1.4%`   

## Known Weaknesses
* In overpaid transactions that require change, the TokenPurchase event will be emitted with the wrong value(but correct token amount).
* Keeping the changeDue variable in storage makes the purchase a bit more expensive gas-wise
